# PewPew-Server-Emulator
Written in Py using Bottle framework as RE practice. In future it'll be updating (maybe).

It's supports both PewPew and PewPew2, difference only in game host.

## How to connect:
 - Added script to [docs](https://github.com/root-7325/PewPew-Docs), but still - how to use it you should find out by yourself ðŸ™ƒ

## What implemented:
 - Database (for leaderboard)
 - Leaderboard (getting scores from server, uploading own)

## Something more:
 - You can checkout some info in [docs](https://github.com/root-7325/PewPew-Docs)
 - You can't run this server on Linux without su. (Port < 1024)

## Kind of disclaimer:
 - I'm not related to original PewPew development team. If you are author of PewPew and you don't want it to be public then please, create Issue and I'll delete this.
 - Also I'm not responsible for any things you do with this source.
